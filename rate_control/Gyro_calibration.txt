X-axis best calibration values:-
scale factor = 128.95   and bias =-72.09


Y-axis:-
scale factor = 131.8    and bias = 100.5


Z-axis:-
scale factor = 129.95  and bias = -86.42




NOTE:::::::

the equation to be writen on the arduino:-

Real rate = (measured rate - bias)/scale factor
